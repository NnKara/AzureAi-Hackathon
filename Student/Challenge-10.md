# (Optional) Challenge 10 - Deploy your intelligent app as a web chatbot

 [< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-09.md) - **[Home](../README.md)**
 
## Introduction

Are you feeling too comfortable and eager to do more? This additional challenge will push your skills further by deploying your application to Azure. 

After optimizing your NL to SQL solution in the previous challenge, it's time to deploy your intelligent app and run it as a web chatbot.

## Description

In this challenge, you will take the NL to SQL app you created in the previous challenge and deploy it in Azure. This involves choosing a web hosting service that suits your needs, such as Azure App Services, Azure Container Apps or any other Azure app hosting service of your preference.

- Azure App Services: This is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. It supports multiple languages and frameworks, and it integrates with other Azure services.
- Azure Container Apps: This service allows you to deploy containerized applications without managing complex infrastructure. It is ideal for microservices and distributed applications.

The goal is to make your app accessible as a web chatbot, where users can interact with it by asking questions in natural language and receiving answers based on actual data. Additionally, you need to ensure that users are authenticated before they can access the chatbot, adding a layer of security to your application.

## Success Criteria
- Demonstrate that you have deployed your chat web app to Azure.
- Demonstrate that you can ask questions in natural language and you get the answers with the actual data.
- Demonstrate that the users are authenticated before accessing the web chatbot.
